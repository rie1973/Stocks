# Stocks

Programmed in Java, this application with track stocks, investors, brokers and investment companies in a portfolio. The program will write all the data to .txt, JSON, and XML files (serialized file code has blocked out, currently debugging this issue). Code for connecting to a database has also been blocked out, as I am still trying to decide what DBMS model I am going to use. 

Please note - some of this code was instructor-provided, as noted in the code comments.
